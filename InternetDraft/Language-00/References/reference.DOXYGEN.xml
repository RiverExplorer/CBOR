				A free and open source tool.
				Doxygen is a widely-used documentation generator tool in
				software development.
				It automates the generation of documentation from source code
				comments, parsing information about classes,
				functions, and variables to produce output in formats like HTML
				and PDF.
				By simplifying and standardizing the documentation process,
				Doxygen enhances collaboration and maintenance across diverse
				programming languages and project scales.
