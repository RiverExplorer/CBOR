	CBOR is a wonderful over the wire format for data.
	This specification is for a CBOR protocol language.
	Currently code to send and receive CBOR streamed data
	of the wire has to be done by hand without
	tools to coordinate and aid in the development.
	Some libraries exist, but no protocol definition
	format could be found that specifically handles CBOR
	over the wire streams.
</t>
<t>
	Many applications are built and compiled with computer
	languages that require that the size and type of variable be known
	at compile time.
	This specification allows an application protocol designer
	to specific the application requirements without regard
	to how CBOR encodes and decodes the data.
</t>
<t>
	This specification defines a CBOR protocol definition language.
	This is the CBOR Language Specification (CLS).
	This language and the sample implementation allows a
	developer to define the application layer objects
	that can be translated into and from a CBOR data streams
	by independently written implementations.
