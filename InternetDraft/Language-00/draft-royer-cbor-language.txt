Abstract

   CBOR is a wonderful over the wire format for data.  This
   specification is for a CBOR protocol language.  And the code to send
   and receive this over the wire protocol currently has to be done by
   hand without tools to coordinate and aid in the development.

   This specification defines a protocol definition language.  This
   language and the sample implementation allowes a developer to define
   the application layer objects that can be translated into and from a
   CBOR data stream.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Introduction

   NOTICE: This is WORK IN PROGRESS

   A CBOR protocol compiler is tool that reads in one or more CBOR
   definition files and produces code that can be used by a computer.
   This code is herein refereed to as generated code.  And the input
   files are called CBOR language files.

   This specification uses C++ and C# in several of the examples.
   However a generator could be produced for almost all computer
   languages.  As the purpose of this is to generate code to be compiled
   and run on a computer, some programming experience is helpful to
   fully understand this specification.

   This specification was written in parallel with the creation of an
   with documentation open source CBOR language protocol compiler
   [CBORgenOpenSource].  and documentation at [cborgendocs].  This was a
   way to help validate the open source compiler and the CBOR language.

   Many computer languages have built in and application defined data
   types that allow for more complex objects that CBOR itself defined.
   The solution is keep breaking down the data type until they are
   objects that can be converted to the CBOR wire protocol.

   For example an object might consist of a persons name with three
   parts, their first, middle, and last name.  This CBOR language allows
   for an object to be created with the purpose of the generating code
   that sends three CBOR textstring objects without the application
   developer having to write the I/O code for each complex data type by
   hand.

   All CBOR data types can be specified in this language as well as more
   complex types built from the CBOR data types.

Internet-Draft                CBOR Language                   April 2025


   Given the same CBOR language file, each CBOR protocol compiler
   generates compatible over the wire data.  Allowing independent
   development.  Application protocols can be developed and designed
   using this language and implementations would not need to hand code
   the reading or writing of the protocol details.

   The goal of this language is to allow two or more cooperating
   applications to exchange data.  It its not to guarantee that all
   generated code will work on all computers.  For example if the
   protocol definition file uses 128-bit integers, then the generated
   code would only compile and work on systems that support 128-bit
   integers.  This could be done if the computer supported native
   128-bit integers, or by using a library that emulates larger
   integers.  As the size of integers and other data types are not the
   same on all systems.  Application designers may need to adjust the
   protocol they define to ensure that all data types they use in the
   protocol are supported by all intended computers.  This goal allows
   for both flexibility, and for future system that may have expanded
   data types.

   The language specification written in the open source ANTLR4:
   https://github.com/antlr/antlr4.  And is much like Yacc/Bison and
   lex/Flex grammar.

3.  Identifiers and Variables

   Each item encoded and decoded in an application will be paced into a
   memory location of the application at run time.  These places are
   named with identifiers.

   And the generic name for this kind of identifier is 'variable'.  And
   a variable may contain any kind of data the applications needs.
   These memory locations are named by the application developer and are
   called variables.

   Another usage of an identifier is to define a new data type to be
   used by the application.

   All variables have a data type (integer, float, ...) and are named in
   this language specification.  And there are user defined data types
   that build onto the built in data types.

3.1.  How to name a variable or identifier

   An identifier can be public for any code to use.  This is in the
   'public' scope.





Royer                    Expires 22 October 2025                [Page 4]

   Or they can be internal to the objects being described.  This is in
   the 'internal' scope.

   Or they can only be accessible within a 'namespace'.  This is in the
   'namespace' scope.  See Namespaces (Section 8).

3.1.1.  Publicly scoped Identifiers

   Public identifiers names must start with a letter from the UTF-8 set:
   a-z or A-Z.  And followed by zero or more from the set: a-z, A-Z,
   0-9, and underscore '_'.  Shown here as a POSIX regular expression
   for an identifier in the public scope:

   identifier
       : IDENTIFIER width?
       ;


                        Figure 1: identifier grammar

   In the example Figure 2, Speed, TimeNow, Time9, Travel_Time,
   Collection, FirstItem and AValue are public identifiers.  As is the
   method name AMethodThatDoesSomething.

   int32_t, uint64_t, and float32_t are built in data types.

   Collection is a public identifier that is defining the name of a new
   user defined data type.

   Examples:

Internet-Draft                CBOR Language                   April 2025


   int32_t Speed;         // Okay public, follows the rules.

   uint64_t TimeNow;      // Okay public, follows the rules.

   float32_t Time9;       // Okay public, follows the rules.

   uint64_t _Travel_Time   // Okay, follows the rules.

   struct Collection      // 'Collection' is valid, and public.
   {
     int8_t    FirstItem; // Okay, value is public.

     float32_t AValue;    // Okay, value is public.

     // A public method that has access to all variables.
     //
     void AMethodThatDoesSomething();
   };

                    Figure 2: Sample with Internal Scope

3.1.2.  Internal Scoped Identifiers

   An internally scoped identifier is an identifier that starts with an
   underscore '_'.

   Internally scoped identifiers can only be accessed from within the
   object they are defined in.  They are often helper variables or
   methods.

   Internally scoped identifiers when not in a namespace and not in a
   struct, are only accessible within the generated code.

   Internally scoped identifiers in a namespace and not in a struct are
   namespace scoped.  And are accessible anywhere in the same namespace.

   Internally scoped identifiers inside of a struct, are only accessible
   within the struct.

   The ANTLR for an internal identifier:

   internal_identifier = '_' identifier

                   Figure 3: internal_identifier grammar

   Examples:

   // Okay Internal, starts with an underscore.
   // _NextSequenceNumber can only be accessed in
   // the generated code.
   //
   uint64_t _NextSequenceNumber;

   // A public identifier, that has internal members.
   //
   struct Collection
   {
     int8_t    ADevice; // Okay, value is public.

     float32_t AValue;  // Okay, value is public.

     int32_t   _AName;  // Okay, value is only
                        // available inside this object.

     // A public method that has access to all variables
     // including internal ones (_AName).
     // And only available inside the protocol implementation.
           //
     void AMethod();

     // An internal method that has access to all variables
     // including internal ones (_AName).
     // This method is only available to be called from within
     // in the Collection object.
     //
     void _AnotherMethod();
   };

                      Figure 4: Internal Scope Example

   See Section 11 for struct details.

3.1.3.  Namespace Scoped Identifiers

   A namespace scoped identifier is an identifier that starts with an
   underscore '_'.  And exists inside of a 'namespace' and not within a
   struct.  See Section 8 to understand namespaces and Structs
   (Section 11) to understand 'struct'.

   Namespace scoped identifiers can only be accessed from within the
   same namespace they are defined in.  They are often variables and
   methods that aid in the cross coordination of objects within the
   namespace.

   *  An identifier defined inside of a struct that starts with an
      underscore '_' is an identifier that is only known within the
      struct and is an internally scoped identifier.

   *  An identifier that is in a namespace, and not within a struct is a
      namespace scoped identifier.

   namespace_identifier = '_' identifier

4.  Variables and Arrays

   Variables may be non-array, fixed size array, or variable sized
   array:

4.1.  Non-Array Variables

   A non-array variable is one that is not a fixed or variable sized
   array.  Examples:

   NOTE: A 'string' is always an array and not a non-array variable.

   Examples:

   uint8_t  SimpleUnsignedInteger;

   float32_t  Simple32BitFloat;

   map<uint8_t,AnObjectType>; SimpleMap;

   multimap<uint8_t,AnObjectType> SimpleMultiMap;

4.2.  Fixed Size Array '[]'

   A fixed size array variable has a size enclosed in square brackets
   '[]'.  Examples:

   Examples:

   uint8_t  FixedUnsignedInteger[30];

   float32_t  Fixed32BitFloat[12];

   map<uint8_t,AnObjectType>; FixedMap[34];

   multimap<uint8_t,AnObjectType> FixedMultiMap[16];

   string LargeString[2048];

4.3.  Variable Size Array '<Max>'

   A variable array size array has a minimum size.  The default minimum
   size is zero.

   A variable array has a maximum size.  The default maximum size is
   unlimited.

   An variable array size is specified in one of 3 ways:

Internet-Draft                CBOR Language                   April 2025


4.3.1.  Variable Size Array With Minimum and Maximum Size

   <Min,Max>
      Where:

      Min  Is the minimum size for the array.  The default minimum is
         zero.

      Max  Is the maximum size of the array.  The default minimum size
         is unlimited.  Unlimited may also be specified as '*'.

      Examples:

      // An array of 5 to 14 int8_t data elements.
      //
      int8_t VariableName<5,14>;

      // An array of 3 to 16 int8_t data elements.
      //
      float32_t FloatArray<3,16>;

      // An string of 5 to 42 characters.
      //
      string StringVariable<5,42>;

      // An string of 8 to unlimited characters.
      //
      string AString<8,*>;

4.3.2.  Variable Size Array With Maximum Size

   <Max>  A shorthand for <0,Max>.  Specifies a zero to Max sized array.

      Example:

      // An array of size zero to 17 in length.
      //
      string VariableName<17>;

4.3.3.  Variable Size Array With Default Size

   <>
      A shorthand for <0,*>.

      Example:

      uint64_t VariableName<>;

Internet-Draft                CBOR Language                   April 2025


4.3.4.  Variable Array Examples

   Examples:

   // A variable array that holds no more than
   // 30 uint8_t items.
   //
   uint8_t  VariableUnsignedInteger1<30>;

   // A variable array of unlimited uint8_t items.
   //
   uint8_t  VariableUnsignedInteger2<>;

   // A variable array of unlimited uint8_t items.
   //
   uint8_t  VariableUnsignedInteger3<*>;

   // A variable array that hold up to 12 float32_t items.
   //
   float32_t  Variable32BitFloat<12>;

   // A more complex example.
   //
   // A variable array that holds up to 34 key/value maps.
   //
   // Each map has keys of type of uint8_t and values
   // of each map are of type AnObjectType.
   //
   // Each of the up to 34 maps, must have a unique key to itself
   // but not to the other maps.
   //
   map<uint8_t,AnObjectType> VariableMap<34>;

   // A variable array of multimaps.
   //
   // Each multimaps has keys of type uin8_t and
   // each multimap has values of type OtherObjectType.
   //
   // The array holds up to 16 of these multimaps.
   // Each multimap may have duplicate keys.
   //
   multimap<uint8_t,OtherObjectType> VariableMultiMap<16>;

5.  CBOR Language Predefined Data Types

   Here is a summary of all of the predefined data types:

Internet-Draft                CBOR Language                   April 2025


   This protocol language closely resembles the CBOR data model.  The
   following data types are defined in the language.  Each of these
   basic data types have a correlating CBOR data type.  When possible
   the data types used in this language are the same as their [POSIX]
   counterpart.

   Some computer languages specify the size of integers.  With this
   language, an implementation still specifies the size and the
   implementation reduces the lesser over the wire size when possible.
   And this implementation will expand them as needed.

   For example, the application may require a 64-unsigned integer
   (uint64_t) named CustomerCount.  And assume only four (4) customers
   exists.  So the implementation sends a one (1) octet CBOR value over
   the wire, in hex it would be 0x04.

   That exemplifies the unique data models of the the application data
   size and the CBOR over the wire data size.  It is the jobs of a
   protocol compiler to translate the received 0x01 into an uint64_t as
   described in this example.  And to notice that a 64-bit value,
   depending on the size of its value, could be sent in as few as one
   octet to as many as ten.

5.1.  Integers

   Integers can be signed or unsigned.  And they can be any size that is
   a multiple of 8 bits wide.

5.1.1.  Unsigned Integer

   This language specifies unsigned integers that are 8 bits, 16 bits,
   32 bits , 64 bits, and bignum.

   uintW_t
      An unsigned integer, 'W' bits wide.  Where 'W' must be a multiple
      of 8.

   ANTLR:

   unsignedInteger
     : 'uint8_t'
           | 'uint16_t'
           | 'uint32_t'
           | 'uint64_t'
           | bigNumUInt
           ;

                     Figure 6: unsignedInteger grammar

   See Section 5.1.1 for details.

   Examples:

   uint8_t EightBitsWide;

   uint16_t SixteenBitsWide;

   uint8_t  An unsigned 8 bit integer.  And the corresponding CBOR data
      type is unsigned int.

   uint16_t  An unsigned 16 bit integer.  And the corresponding CBOR
      data type is unsigned int.

   uint32_t  An unsigned 32 bit integer.  And the corresponding CBOR
      data type is unsigned int.

   uint64_t  An unsigned 64 bit integer.  And the corresponding CBOR
      data type is unsigned int.

   uint72_t  An unsigned 72 bit integer.  And the corresponding CBOR
      data type is bignum.

   uint128_t  An unsigned 128 bit integer.  And the corresponding CBOR
      data type is bignum.

   ... uintW_t ...  Assuming 'W' is more than 64 and a multiple of 8.
      An unsigned 'W'-bits integer.  And the corresponding CBOR data
      type is bignum.

   And the implementation transmits the unsigned integer value, not the
   data type.  A uint128_t unsigned integer with a value of one (1)
   would be transmitted as 0x01, a one octet value.

   The 72, 128, and 'W' bit length unsigned integer data types are just
   examples used to illustrate that this protocol definition language
   can specify what the application needs and an implementation
   translates that to and from the smallest CBOR data value when used.
   And note that the 72 and 128 ones are valid in this language along
   with other nonstandard sizes.

5.1.2.  Signed Integer

   This language specifies signed integers that are 8 bits, 16 bits, 32
   bits , 64 bits, and bignum.

   And the implementation transmits the signed integer value, not the

   can specify what the application needs and an implementation
   translates that to and from the smallest CBOR data value when used.
   And note that the 72 and 128 ones are valid in this language.

5.1.3.  Big Integers

   CBOR supports signed and unsigned integers as 'bignum'.  An
   implementation will transport non-standard size signed and unsigned
   integers as CBOR bignum.

5.2.  Float

   ANTLR:

   float
     : 'float16_t'
           | 'float32_t'

   Examples:

   float16_t Size;

   float32_t BiggerSize;

   Floating point numbers are similar to unsigned integers except they
   are prefixed with 'float' and not 'uint'.

   float16_t  A 16-bit floating point number.  And the corresponding
      CBOR data type is float.

   float32_t  A 32-bit floating point number.  And the corresponding

   float64_t  A 64-bit floating point number.  And the corresponding

   ... floatLL_t ...  Assuming LL is more than 64 and a multiple of 8.
      An LL-bits floating point number.  And the corresponding CBOR data
      type is bigfloat.

5.3.  String

   string  A string.  A A variable array of characters.

      Examples:

      // A string that has no less than 1
      // and no more than 30 characters.
      //
      string AStringVariableName<1,30>;

      // A string that has no less than 4
      // and no limit on the total size.
      //
      string OtherString<4,*>;

      // A string that has exactly 40 characters.
      //
      string OtherString[40];

   ANTLR:

   string : 'string' ;

                          Figure 9: string grammar

5.4.  Maps and MultiMaps

   A map is a key and value pair, all keys in a map are unique.  A
   multimap is a map where duplicate keys may exist.

   A map is a CBOR major type 5 as defined in CBOR [RFC8949].

   CBOR mandates that the keys be in bytewise lexicographic order
   Section 4.2.1 of [RFC8949].  Some application keys can be objects,
   and not simple integer or string values, making objects sorting order
   not easily determinable.  Two things needed to be added to an object
   to make it a sortable key.

   (1) The object defined using this language must be marked with the
   '[sortable]' attribute.

   (2) A method must be defined in the object named 'Compare' that will
   be implemented by the implementer to determine the sorting order.

   This Compare method returns -1 when the object is considered less
   than the Other object.  This Compare method returns 0 when the object
   is considered equal to the Other object.  This Compare method returns
   1 when the object is considered greater than the Other object.

   Here is an example of two objects that form one key (Outer):

   [sortable]
   struct InnerObject
   {
     string   Name;

     uint8_t  Age;

     // A [sortable] object must have a Compare() method.
     //
     // The implementations and applications that use
     // this object must agree on how this comparison
     // is done.
     //
     int Compare(InnterObject Other);
   };

   [sortable]
   struct OuterObject
   {
     uint64_t    UniqueID;

     InnerObject NameAge;

     // In this example, this Compare method also
     // calls the NameAge.Compare() to determine
     // the sorting order. However in another case
     // it is possible it can be compared with just the
     // UniqueID.
     //
     // The implementations and applications that use
     // this object must agree on how this comparison
     // is done.
     //
     int Compare(OuterObject Other);
   };

   // And here the complex OuterObject is being used
   // as a map key.
   //
   map<OuterObject,uint8_t> UsesComplexKey;

   Each unique Compare() method defined, must be implemented by the
   implementer.  One for each object or variable marked as '[sortable]'.

   When an object it marked as sortable, and it contains one or more
   objects that are marked as sortable, then the outer most object's
   Compare() method result is the one that will be used to determine the
   sorting order.  Which may or might not call the other Compare()
   methods for any included objects.  How they are compared is part the
   the using application design.

5.4.1.  Map

   The CBOR language map data type has two arguments, the key type, and
   the value type.  And is defined in ANTLR as:

   map
     : 'map' '<' typeSpecifier ',' typeSpecifier '>'
           ;


                           Figure 10: map grammar

   Here are examples a map in the CBOR language:

   // The key is an 8-bit integer.
   // The value is a 32-bit integer.
   //
   map<uint8_t,int32_t>     VariableName1;

   // The key is an 8-bit integer.
   // The value is a string with at least one character.
   //
   map<uint8_t,string<1,*>> VariableName2;

   // Two example objects.
   //
   struct Object1
   {
     int32_t   Collected[45];
     float16_t Values[45];
   };

   struct Object2
   {
     Object1   CurrentItems<>;
     Object1   History<>;
   };

   // A more complex map.
   //
   map<Object1,Object2>   SomeVariableName3;

5.4.2.  Multimap

   A multimap allows for duplicate keys.

   When an application has a multimap that needs to be transmitted via
   CBOR, it sends a map, except the value becomes an array of objects,
   all that have the same key.  One key sent, all of the objects with
   that key sent as an array, as the value to that key.

   Here is the ANTLR definition of a multimap in the CBOR language:

   multimap
     : 'multimap' '<' typeSpecifier ',' typeSpecifier '>'
           ;

                        Figure 11: multimap grammar

   A multimap is a map that allows multiple of the same keys.  Here is
   an example of a multimap of a graphic object being duplicated at
   multiple positions in a 3 dimensional space.

   The multimap uses the same sorting as described in Maps
   (Section 5.4.1)

   struct Vector3
   {
     float32_t X;
     float32_t Y;
     float32_t Z;
   };

   // An example of a multimap where the key is the identifier of
   // a specific graphic object type, with an ID that is an
   // unsigned 32-bit integer.
   //
   // And the value is its position.
   //
   // Any object may have multiple instances of the same graphic
   // object, all with the same ID, and each with its position
   // at a different location.
   //
   multimap<uint32_t,Vector3> Instances;

   This example would be transmitted as one CBOR map.  There would be
   one map key for each unique uint32_t key.  And Each key would have an
   array of one or more Vector3 objects.

Internet-Draft                CBOR Language                   April 2025


   The protocol compiler would implement; for each unique multimap, a
   method to convert and encode a computer language multimap into a CBOR
   map.  And a method to decode and convert the map back into a
   multimap.

6.  Arrays

   Arrays can be fixed length, or variable length.  Fixed length arrays
   have all of their elements transmitted each time, thus each element
   must contain a valid value.

6.1.  Fixed Length Arrays

   Fixed length arrays have their size bounded by square brackets.  Here
   are some examples:

   Variable Length Array Examples.

   // An array that consists of three 32 bit floating
   // point numbers.
   //
   float32_t Transform3D[3];

   // An array that contains 1024 8-bit signed integer values.
   //
   int8_t Samples[1024];

6.2.  Variable Length Arrays

   Variable length arrays can have a variable number of elements.  You
   can specify the minimum number of elements, the default is zero (0).
   You can specify the maximum number of elements, the default is an
   unlimited amount of entries.  An unlimited maximum value is indicated
   with the '*' symbol.

   Fixed length arrays have their size bounded by angle brackets.  Here
   are some examples:

   Variable Length Array Examples:

   // A variable length array that can hold zero,
   // or up to an unlimited number of 32 bit
   // floating point entries.
   // The minimum value is empty and the maximum value is empty.
   //
   float32_t Samples<>;<

   // A variable length array that can hold zero,
   // or up to 100 32-bit unsigned entries.
   //
   uint32_t DistanceMarks<0,100>;

   // A variable length array that must contain at least 2
   // 32-bit floating point numbers and no more than
   // 128 entries.
   //
   float32_t Trajectory<2,128>;

   // A variable length array that must contain at least 2
   // 32-bit floating point numbers and an unlimited
   // number of entries.
   //
   float32_t Variation<2,*>;

7.  Declaring Variables

   A variable has a type and a name.  And the name can have some
   attributes.  The ANTLR for a variable declaration is:

   declaration : typeSpecifier identifier
           | typeSpecifier identifier '[' value ']'
           | typeSpecifier identifier '<' value? '>'
           | 'opaque' identifier '[' value ']'
           | 'opaque' identifier '<' value? '>'
           | 'string' identifier '<' value? '>'
           | 'void'
           ;


                       Figure 12: declaration grammar

8.  Namespaces

   With large protocols it can be difficult to make sure that names of
   items are unique.  Namespace allows groups of names to be
   encapsulated and identified without regard to the names of items in
   other namespaces or globally.




Royer                    Expires 22 October 2025               [Page 23]

Internet-Draft                CBOR Language                   April 2025


   For example, a protocol might have a unique identifier for the
   sequence of an item and declare a type called UID.

   Another set of exchanges might be to tranfer sets of data, each with
   a unique identifier and declare a type called UID.

   In this simple example, it is concevable that you just make sure that
   you do not use both in the same set.  However with large projects
   cross identifier errors can happen and can be difficult to track
   down.

   Namespace solve this problem by wrapping objects, or sets of object
   in a 'namespace' type.  Here is a simple example:

   // Declare a type called UID that is
   // a 64-bit unsigned integer.
   // In this scope is a sequence number.
   //
   typedef unint64_t UID;

   struct Packet
   {
     UID Sequence;
     Blob ABlobOdData; // Blob not defined in this example.
   };

   And in another definition file you might have defined this:

   // Declare a type called UID that is
   // a 64-bit unsigned integer.
   // In this scope, the UID identifies a set of data (Blob2).
   //
   typedef unint64_t UID;

   struct EnumeratedItems
   {
     UID ItemIdentifier;
           Blob2 TheItemData;// Blob2 not defined in this example.
   };

   And when you compile your protocol you get an error that you defined
   UID twice (or more).

   The solution could be to rename one of them.  Or to use namespaces:

Internet-Draft                CBOR Language                   April 2025


   namespace Packets
   {
     // Declare a type called UID that is
     // a 64-bit unsigned integer.
     // In this scope is a sequence number.
     //
     typedef unint64_t UID;

     struct Packet
     {
       UID Sequence;
       Blob ABlobOdData; // Blob not defined in this example.
     };
   } // End of namespace /Packets'.

   namespace ItemList
   {
     // Declare a type called UID that is
     // a 64-bit unsigned integer.
     // In this scope, the UID identifies a set of data (Blob2).
     //
     typedef unint64_t UID;

     struct EnumeratedItems
     {
       UID ItemIdentifie;
       Blob2 TheItemData;// Blob2 not defined in this example.
     };
   }

   When in the implementation where you need to access the public
   identifiers from other namespaces they could be identified by using
   their full scope.  In C++ this could look like:

   ItemList::EnumeratedItems Items;
   Packets::Packet           APacket

   ItemList::UID             ItemUID;
   Packets::UID              PacketUID;

   And in C# it would look like:

   ItemList.EnumeratedItems Items;
   Packets.Packet           APacket;

   ItemList.UID             ItemUID;
   Packets.UID              PacketUID;

9.  User Type Definitions

   A typedef is both a shorthand way of specifying a data type.  And it
   allows for the identification of the intended usage of otherwise
   ambiguous data type usage.  This can also help find coding errors.

   The typedef and its concept are the same as they are in C/C++.

   The ANTLR for typedef:

   typeDef
       : 'typedef' declaration ';'
       | 'enum' identifier enumBody ';'
       | ('struct'|'class') identifier structBody ';'
       | 'union' identifier unionBody ';'
       ;

                                 Figure 13

   In Figure 14 and Figure 15 there is an error as both the Sequence and
   Command are different sizes.  If one definition file has:

   struct Packet
   {
     // A map of Sequence to command.
     //
     map<uint32_t,uint32_t> History;
     ...
   };

                                 Figure 14

   And a second file has a definition for a method to use the packet
   data:

   // On many systems this would compile
   // because the 'add' line would not know
   // that Sequence and command were too small as
   // the compilers automatically upcast to larger sizes.
   // Only later at runtime when Sequence or Command exceeded
   // the size of uint16_t might the errors be caught.
   //
   void ProcessPacket(uint16_t Sequence, uint16_t Command)
   {
     ...
     // Error - should be (Seq, Cmd)
     // However it would compile as the compiler
     // only sees that they are both unsigned integers.
     // (NOTE: map does not have a '.add', just an demonstration).
     //
     History.add(Cmd, Seq);

   If typedefs had been used it would catch that error and also make it
   easier to read:

   // Create a data type called 'PacketSequence'
   //
   typdef uint32_t PacketSequence;

   // Create a data type called 'PacketCommand'
   //
   typedef uint32_t PacketCommand;

   // Create a data type called 'SequenceHistory'
   //
   typedef map<PacketSequence,PacketCommand> SequenceHistory;

   struct Packet
   {
     // A map of Sequence to command.
     //
     SequenceHistory History;
     ...
   };

                                 Figure 16

   And if the second usage had been defined as:

   void ProcessPacket(PacketSequence Seq, PacketCommand Cmd)
   {
     // This would not compile as the types do not match.
     // (NOTE: '.add' is made up for demonstartion only)
     //
     History.add(Cmd, Seq); // Error - should be (Seq, Cmd)

     // This would, and should compile.
     //
     History.add(Seq,Cmd);
     ...
   }

10.  Enum

   Much like an enum in C/C++/C# the purpose of the enum is to create
   identifiers and assign numeric values to them in order to simply
   reading and understanding the code.

   The enum ANTLR:

   enum       = 'enum' enum-name '{'
                 enum-item *(',' enum-item)
                '};'

   enum-item  = UserDefinedIdentifier '=' Value

   enum-name  = UserDefinedIdentifier

   Value      = 0x00-0xffffffff

   *  No two enum-item identifiers may be the same in the same enum.

   *  No two enum-item identifiers may have the same value in the same
      enum.

   *  All enum-items are at the same scope as the enum-name

   *  An enum-name and therefore the enum may be in the public,
      internal, or namespace scope.

   Examples:

   enum RoomsInAHome {
     Kitchen = 1,
     LivingRoom = 2,
     BedRoom = 3
   };

   enum DaysOfTheWeek {
     Monday = 1,
     Tuesday = 2,
     Wednesday = 3,
     Thursday = 4,
     Friday = 5,
     Saturday = 6
     Sunday = 7
   };


11.  Structues

   A struct is a way to encapsulate a related set of variables.

   Struct ANTLR:

   structTypeSpec
       : ('struct'|'class') structBody
       ;
