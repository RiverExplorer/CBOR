                   CBOR Language Specification (CLS)
                      draft-royer-cbor-language-00

Abstract

   CBOR is a wonderful over the wire format for data.  This
   specification is for a CBOR protocol language.  Currently code to
   send and receive CBOR streamed data of the wire has to be done by
   hand without tools to coordinate and aid in the development.  Some
   libraries exist, but no protocol definition format could be found
   that specifically handles CBOR over the wire streams.

   Many applications are built and compiled with computer languages that
   require that the size and type of variable be known at compile time.
   This specification allows an application protocol designer to
   specific the application requirements without regard to how CBOR
   encodes and decodes the data.

   This specification defines a CBOR protocol definition language.  This
   is the CBOR Language Specification (CLS).  This language and the
   sample implementation allows a developer to define the application
   layer objects that can be translated into and from a CBOR data
   streams by independently written implementations.

2.  Introduction

   NOTICE: This is WORK IN PROGRESS

   This document specifies a CBOR Language Specification (CLS).  The
   purpose of the CLS is to be able to define a consistent over the wire
   protocol definitions that transfer data between endpoints with the
   data encoded and decoded as specified in CBOR.

   A CBOR protocol compiler is tool that reads in one or more CBOR
   definition files and produces code that can be used by a computer.
   This code is herein refereed to as generated code.  And the input
   files are called CBOR Language Specification files, or CLS files.
   Within this document such files in examples use the ".cls" file name
   extension.

Internet-Draft         CBOR Language Specification              May 2025


   CBOR specifies how to transfer the data.  And CLS specifies what will
   be transferred.

   This specification uses C/C++ and C# in several of the examples.
   However a generator could be produced for almost all computer
   languages.  As the purpose of this is to generate code to be compiled
   and run on a computer, some programming experience is helpful to
   fully understand this specification.

   Many of the code examples are commented using the doxygen [DOXYGEN]
   style of commenting.

   This specification was written in parallel with the creation of an
   open source CBOR language protocol compiler [CLSOpenSource].  The
   documentation at [CLSgendocs].  This was a way to help validate the
   open source compiler and this specification.

   Many computer languages have built in and application defined data
   types that allow for more complex objects that CBOR itself defined.
   The solution is breakdown the more complex data type until they are
   objects that can be converted to and from the CBOR stream format.
   And then consolidating them during decoding.

   For example an object might consist of a persons name with three
   parts, their first, middle, and last name.  This CBOR language allows
   for an object to be created with the purpose of the generating code
   that sends three CBOR text string objects without the application
   developer having to write the I/O code for each complex data type by
   hand.

   All CBOR data types can be specified in this language as well as more
   complex types built from the CBOR data types.

   Given the same CLS input file, each CBOR protocol compiler generates
   compatible over the wire data.  Allowing independent development.
   Application protocols can be developed and designed using this
   language and implementations would not need to hand code the reading
   or writing of the protocol details.

   The goal of this language is to allow two or more cooperating
   applications to exchange data.  It its not to guarantee that all
   generated code will work on all computers.  For example if the
   protocol definition file uses 128-bit integers, then the generated
   code would only compile and work on systems that support 128-bit
   integers.  This could be done if the computer supported native
   128-bit integers, or by using a library that emulates larger
   integers.  As the size of integers and other data types are not the
   same on all systems.  Application designers may need to adjust the

   protocol they define to ensure that all data types they use in the
   protocol are supported by all intended computers.  This goal allows
   for both flexibility, and for future systems that may have expanded
   data types.

   The sample implementation was written using the open source ANTLR4
   compiler: https://github.com/antlr/antlr4.  And is much like
   Yacc([YACC])/Bison([BISON]) and lex([LEX])/Flex([FLEX]) grammar.

   Some data requires synchronous interactions.  And other data may be
   transmitted asynchronously.  See Async and Sync Data (Section 13).

   Some data such as audio and video may be streamed and not sent as
   blocks of data.  Streamed data may be send asynchronously or
   synchronously See Stream Data (Section 14)

3.  CLS Basics

3.1.  UTC and Array Overview

   The UTC value used in this specification is designed to be compatible
   with time_t on [POSIX] compliant systems.  In POSIX systems, time_t
   is defined as an integer type used for representing time in seconds
   since the UNIX epoch, which is 00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970.  And
   in this specification is 64-bit unsigned integer.

   Arrays are used in a lot of data flows.  String are always an array
   of printable characters.  Some data needs to be converted to a from
   network byte order.  Data that does not need to be converted to and
   from network byte order is called 'opaque' data.  A PNG file is an
   example of opaque data.  The PNG data itself is defined so that it is
   readable without any additional encoding.

   In this CBOR Language Specification (CLS), a data type that is an
   array, is fixed in length, or variable in length.

   A fixed array:

   *  A fixed array has its length surrounded by square brackets '[' and
      ']'.

   *  Each element in a fixed array is exactly the same size.

   *  The total size of a fixed array is calculated by multiplying the
      array length by the size of each element in the fixed array.

   *  A fixed size array can never be empty or null.

Internet-Draft         CBOR Language Specification              May 2025


   A variable sized array.  A variable array is one of two types:

   *  It is an array of UTF-8 characters, called a string.

   *  Or it is an array of some non string data type.

   Common to all variable array types:

   *  Both a string and non-string variable array may have a maximum
      length surrounded by angle brackets:

      '<' max-length '>'.

   *  Or they specify an unlimited length by having empty angle
      brackets, no maximum length specified.  In this context
      'unlimited' means not pre-defined.

      '<>'.

   *  Any variable array may have zero entries at run time.  This is an
      empty array and is valid in this language specification.

   *  Any variable arrays may be null at run time.  This is an null
      array and is valid in this language specification.  And are
      transmitted as CBOR 'null' values.

   Non-string variable arrays:

   *  Non-string variable arrays are defined by specifying their data
      type, and their optional maximum length.

   *  Variable arrays that are not string arrays have their total size
      calculated by multiplying the array length (which may or might not
      be the same as any optional maximum length) by the size of each
      element in the variable array.  A non-string variable array size
      is always less than or the same as any optional maximum length.

   *  All elements in a non-string variable array have exactly the same
      size.

   String variable arrays:

   *  A variable array of UTF-8 characters is a 'string' array.  String
      arrays are defined using the 'string' data type.

   *  Variable arrays that are string arrays (a string data type) have
      their total size calculated by adding up the number of octets in
      all of the characters in the array.  Which may or might not be the

Internet-Draft         CBOR Language Specification              May 2025


      same as any optional maximum length.  And the size (octet count)
      may be up to 4 times the maximum length (character count).  Each
      UTF-8 character may be 1, 2, 3, or 4 octets in size.

      This is why a 'string' can not be a fixed size array, as you may
      not know the total number of octets when generating the code.  And
      clipping off parts of a UTF-8 4, 3, or 2 octet character makes the
      string useless.  If a string was a fixed array, then you have to
      describe how to pad the unused values each time, and decide on
      left or right padding.

   string
      *  A string is always a variable array.  If you need a fixed size
         character array, use a fixed array of 8 (ASCII), 16 (UTF-16),
         or 32 (UTF-32), values.

      *  A string may contain zero characters, this is an empty string.

      *  A string be null, in which is valid and is transmitted as a
         CBOR 'null'.

      *  A string is an array of UTF-8 printable characters.  With an
         optional maximum length.

      *  A string is an array of printable characters.  And each
         character may be 1, 2, 3, or 4 octets in size.  The length
         specifies the number of printable characters in the string not
         the size of the array.  This is also why a string can not be a
         fixed array.

      *  The octet count (size) of any string, could be the same as the
         number of characters (length), or the size could be up to 4
         times larger.

      *  The length is the number of characters in the array.

      *  The size is the number of octets in the array.

      *  The length is always equal to or less than the size.

   // A string variable array of printable
   // characters, unlimited in length.
   //
   string MyVariableName<>;

   // A string variable array of printable
   // characters, up to 25 characters in
   // length. And up to 100 octets is size.
   //
   string MyVariableName2<25>;

   opaque
      *  An opaque array is an array of 8-bit octets.  And will not be
         network byte encoded or decoded.

      *  The size and length of an opaque array are always the same
         value.

   // This is a fixed array that is always
   // 42 octets in size.
   // All 'opaque' objects are 8-bit values.

   opaque MyOpaqueData[42];

   // A variable length array up to 42

   //
   opaque MyOpaqueData<42>;

   // A variable length array of unlimited
   // number of 8-bit octets.
   //
   opaque MyOpaqueData<>;

   Variable arrays in CBOR have a "<>" in them to indicate they are
   variable arrays.

   Fixed arrays in CBOR have a "[]" in them to indicate they are fixed
   size arrays.

3.2.  Indefinite Length Arrays

   Variable arrays that have their encoding started before the length is
   know will transmit the data with the CBOR additional information
   value 31.  And will be terminated with the CBOR "break" stop code 31.
   As defined in CBOR.

   And they will be tagged in the protocol definition file as
   "[stream]".

   No array without the "[stream]" tag will be encoded as a CBOR
   indefinite length value.

   An array with the "[stream]" tag may be transmitted as a CBOR non-
   indefinite length value if known before the encoding begins.

   Examples of an indefinite variable length array where the encoding
   starts before the length is known:

   [stream] float16_t MicrophoneInputData<>;

   [stream] uint8_t LiveTelemetry<>;

   [stream] string LiveTranscription<>;

                                  Figure 1

   The "[stream]" tag is a hint to the implementation that the data
   tagged needs to be able to be processed before the length is known.

3.3.  Channels

   Some interactions in a data stream require a complete transfer of
   data before the logic of the application can proceed.  This type of
   data is synchronous data, and is the default.  It does not mean that
   the other endpoint must reply.  It means the data must be transferred
   or sent before the application goes to its next programmed operation.

   In some cases the data transfer can occur over time.  For example a
   live transcription can occur at the same time that a user is reading
   their email on the same session.  One way to implement this is with
   threading.  Threading is a programming technique where separate flows
   of application logic can be processed in parallel.

   There are two basic ways to do parallel data transfer.

   *  Open two or more sessions.  One for each parallel operation.

   *  Multiplex the data over one connection.

   Opening two or more sessions is out of scope for this specification
   because no additional specification beyond what is needed with
   multiplex coordination would be needed.  And Servers may limit the
   number of simultaneous connections from the same authenticated user.

Internet-Draft         CBOR Language Specification              May 2025


   A multiplexed transfer of data requires a in-stream switching
   mechanism.  This mechanism is called channeling.  Both endpoints must
   be capable of and agree to channeling.

   All objects that are to be channeled have the "[channel N]" tag
   applied to them.  With 'N' being the channel number.  The "[channel
   N]" tag can be added to any data type, structure, or method.

   All objects that do not have a "[channel N]" tag are done in the
   single session connection, which is channel zero (0) and must be done
   synchronously.

   The "[channel N]" tag has a mandatory parameter indicating the
   channel number or name.  Channel numbers are positive integers.
   Channel zero (0) is reserved for synchronous communication only and
   is the default.  Channel names must be identifiers (Section 4).  And
   only one synchronous channel may exist, and it must be channel zero
   (0).  When not tagged, the default is "[channel 0]" Tagging with
   "[channel 0]" is the same as not tagging the object.

   The multiplexing is done without the application knowing it is done.
   The application sends a blob of data, and the underlying
   implementation breaks it into pieces as needed based on the amount of
   backlogged data across all channels.

   As an aid to reading CLS files, a channel may be assigned a name.
   The name must be defined before its first use in "[channel N]".

   Exampling naming a channel:

  channel[1] = Notifications;

  // Channel numbers only have to be
  // unique positive numbers,
  // They do not have to be sequential.
  //
  channel[12] = LiveTranscript;

  // And used:
  //
  [channel LiveTranscript] [stream] string TranscriptText<>;

  [channel Notifications] [async] GetNotifications(Callback_Identifier);

3.4.  Async

   All Objects may be tagged with the "[async]" tag.  The "[async]" tag
   indicates that the application has sent the data, and will not wait
   for the reply.  Instead, the CLS implementation will notify the
   application a reply has been received.

3.5.  Number of bits in value

   The CBOR protocol Language allows for bit value, bits values, and bit
   masks, See BITS (Section 12)

   In this specification terminal values may specify a bit width.
   Indicating the number of bits in the value.

   Where the "width" is the number of bits in the value.  And must be an
   unsigned integer greater than zero.  And is always expressed in
   decimal.

   When the left side of a rule has a width: The number of bits on the
   left side must equal the number of bits on the right side.

   The most significant values are placed to the left of lesser
   signification values in the rule:

   In this example A Header is 32-bits in size and is composed of an
   8-bit (Offset), 2-bit (Flags or F), and 22-bit (Length) value.

   Here in CBOR protocol language:

   Header:32 = Offset:8 Flags:2 Length:22

                                  Figure 3

   They are written most significant bits to least significant bits.
   So, Length (Figure 3) is 22 bits and occupies the least significant
   bits in the value.

   Example pseudo code for the CLS in Figure 3 could be:

   // Header is a 32-bit unsigned integer.
   // Offset is an 8-bit unsigned integer.
   // Flags (F) is a 2-bit unsigned integer.
   // Length is a 22-bit unsigned integer
   //
   Header = (Offset << 24) | (Flags << 22) | Length;

                                  Figure 4

   The pseudo code in Figure 4 shifts the 8-bit "Offset" over 24 bits to
   the left, then shifts the 2-bit value "Flags (F)" over 22 bits, then,
   places the lower 24-bits "Length" into the results.  The result would
   be all three values into the one 32-bit result as illustrated in
   Figure 5.

   NOTE: Bits do not have to fill up any value, and can span multiple
   values.  See BITS (Section 12)

                     8-bits | 8-bits | 8-bits | 8-bits |
                   +--------+---+----+--------+--------+
                   | Offset | F |  Length              |

3.6.  Data Types - Detail

   The CLS language allows the developer to code for application, many
   of which are built with computer languages that require known and
   compiled in data sizes.  These sizes are converted to and from CBOR
   stream format as needed.

   Floating point numbers implementation notes.  Many sizes exist
   depending on the operating system and compilers used.  Some sizes
   used are 16, 24, 32, 40, 64, and 80, 96, and 128 bit floating point
   numbers.  Generally implementations should go to the next larger size
   in their implementation if they do not natively support a size in the
   protocol definition file.  Protocol designers should specify in the
   protocol file any size or precision requirements as comments in the
   file.

   Implementation that require specific floating point widths could
   implement them as a user defined data type:

3.7.  StringRef and DataRef

   This protocol allows for the reference to strings and data objects,
   by octet offset into the object.  This is is called a StringRef or
   DataRef.  The StringRef and DataRef do not contain the string or
   data, it is a reference to data in an existing string or data object.
   An example usage is in an index object that points to data within a
   string or data, such as the parts of a multipart MIME object.  They
   consists of two parts:

   +========+========+================================================+
   | Name   | Size   | Description                                    |
   +========+========+================================================+
   | Offset | uint_t | The octet count to the start of the data.      |
   |        |        | With zero being the first octet in the object. |
   +--------+--------+------------------------------------------------+
   | Length | uint_t | The length in octets of the referenced object  |
   |        |        | in the data.                                   |
   +--------+--------+------------------------------------------------+

             Table 2: StringRef and DataRef ABNF/CBOR Mapping

   The only difference between a StringRef and a DataRef is that a
   String ref points to readable string values that may be 1, 2, 3, or 4
   octets in length each.  And a DataRef points to objects that are
   always 8-bits in size.

   Here is an example of a StringRef over the wire that is 8 octets in
   size.

                   +----------------------------------+

Internet-Draft         CBOR Language Specification              May 2025


   This protocol language closely resembles the CBOR data model.  The
   following data types are defined in the language.  Each of these
   basic data types have a correlating CBOR data type.  When possible
   the data types used in this language are the same as their [POSIX]
   counterpart.

   Some computer languages specify the size of integers.  With this
   language, an implementation still specifies the size and the
   implementation reduces the lesser over the wire size when possible.
   And this implementation will expand them as needed.

   For example, the application may require a 64-unsigned integer
   (uint64_t) named CustomerCount.  And assume only four (4) customers
   exists.  So the implementation sends a one (1) octet CBOR value over
   the wire, in hex it would be 0x04.

   That exemplifies the unique data models of the the application data
   size and the CBOR over the wire data size.  It is the jobs of a
   protocol compiler to translate the received 0x01 into an uint64_t as
   described in this example.  And to notice that a 64-bit value,
   depending on the size of its value, could be sent in as few as one
   octet to as many as ten.

3.8.1.  Integers

   Integers can be signed or unsigned.  And they can be any size that is
   a multiple of 8 bits wide.

3.8.1.1.  Unsigned Integer

   This language specifies unsigned integers that are 8 bits, 16 bits,
   32 bits , 64 bits, and bignum.

   uint[W]_t
      An unsigned integer, 'W' bits wide.  Where 'W' must be a multiple
      of 8.

      Examples of sizes not predefined: int40_t, int128_t

   The ANTLR specification for unsigned integer:

     ;

   See Section 3.8.1.1 for details.

   Examples:

   uint8_t EightBitsWide;

   uint16_t SixteenBitsWide;

   A CBOR implementation transmits the unsigned integer value, not the
   data type.  A uint128_t unsigned integer with a value of one (1)
   would be transmitted as 0x01, a one octet value.

   The 72, 128, and 'W' bit length unsigned integer data types are just
   examples used to illustrate that this protocol definition language
   can specify what the application needs and an implementation
   translates that to and from the smallest CBOR data value when used.
   And note that the 72 and 128 ones are valid in this language along
   with other nonstandard sizes.

3.8.1.2.  Signed Integer

   This language specifies signed integers that are 8 bits, 16 bits, 32
   bits , 64 bits, and bignum.

   intW_t
      An signed integer, 'W' bits wide.  Where 'W' must be a multiple of

   See Section 3.8.1.1 for details.

   Examples:

   int8_t EightBitsWide;

   int16_t SixteenBitsWide;

   A CBOR implementation transmits the signed integer value, not the
   data type.  A int128_t signed integer with a value of negative one
   (-1) would be transmitted as a CBOR major type 1 0b00100000 (0x20), a
   one octet value.

   The 72, 128, and 'W' bit length signed integer data types are just
   examples used to illustrate that this protocol definition language
   can specify what the application needs and an implementation
   translates that to and from the smallest CBOR data value when used.
   And note that the 72 and 128 ones are valid in this language.

3.8.1.3.  Big Integers

   CBOR supports larger signed and unsigned integers as 'bignum'.  An
   implementation conforming to this specification will transmit the
   value in a small of a CBOR size as possible.

   A value of one (1) could be transmitted as a bignum, and it would not
   conform to this specification as the single octet version is smaller.
   The non-bignum version is to be used when possible.  When they fit,
   unsigned integers are to be transmitted as CBOR major type 0, and
   signed integers as CBOR major type 1.

3.8.2.  Float

3.8.4.  Maps and MultiMaps

   A map is a key and value pair, all keys in a map are unique.  A
   multimap is a map where duplicate keys may exist.

   A map is a CBOR major type 5 as defined in CBOR [RFC8949].

   CBOR mandates that the keys be in bytewise lexicographic order
   Section 4.2.1 of [RFC8949].  Some application keys can be objects,
   and not simple integer or string values, making objects sorting order
   not easily determinable.  Two things needed to be added to an object
   to make it a sortable key.

   (1) The object defined using this language must be marked with the
   '[sortable]' attribute.

   (2) A method must be defined in the object named 'Compare' that will
   be implemented by the implementer to determine the sorting order.

   This Compare method returns -1 when the object is considered less
   than the Other object.  This Compare method returns 0 when the object
   is considered equal to the Other object.  This Compare method returns
   1 when the object is considered greater than the Other object.

   Here is an example of two objects that form one key (Outer):

   [sortable]
   struct InnerObject
   {
     string   Name;

     uint8_t  Age;

     // A [sortable] object must have a Compare() method.
     //
     // The implementations and applications that use
     // this object must agree on how this comparison
     // is done.
     //
     int Compare(InnterObject Other);
   };

   [sortable]
   struct OuterObject
   {
     uint64_t    UniqueID;

     InnerObject NameAge;

     // In this example, this Compare method also
     // calls the NameAge.Compare() to determine
     // the sorting order. However in another case
     // it is possible it can be compared with just the
     // UniqueID.
     //
     // The implementations and applications that use
     // this object must agree on how this comparison
     // is done.
     //
     int Compare(OuterObject Other);
   };

   // And here the complex OuterObject is being used
   // as a map key.
   //
   map<OuterObject,uint8_t> UsesComplexKey;

   Each unique Compare() method defined, must be implemented by the
   implementer.  One for each object or variable marked as '[sortable]'.








Royer                   Expires 27 November 2025               [Page 22]

Internet-Draft         CBOR Language Specification              May 2025


   When an object it marked as sortable, and it contains one or more
   objects that are marked as sortable, then the outer most object's
   Compare() method result is the one that will be used to determine the
   sorting order.  Which may or might not call the other Compare()
   methods for any included objects.  How they are compared is part the
   the using application design.

3.8.4.1.  Map

   The CBOR language map data type has two arguments, the key type, and
   the value type.  And is defined in ANTLR as:

   map
     : 'map' '<' typeSpecifier ',' typeSpecifier '>'
     ;


                           Figure 14: map grammar

   Here are examples a map in the CBOR language:

   // The key is an 8-bit integer.
   // The value is a 32-bit integer.
   //
   map<uint8_t,int32_t>     VariableName1;

   // The key is an 8-bit integer.
   // The value is a string with at least one character.
   //
   map<uint8_t,string<1,*>> VariableName2;

   // Two example objects.
   //
   struct Object1
   {
     int32_t   Collected[45];
     float16_t Values[45];
   };

   struct Object2
   {
     Object1   CurrentItems<>;
     Object1   History<>;
   };

   // A more complex map.
   //
   map<Object1,Object2>   SomeVariableName3;

3.8.4.2.  Multimap

   A multimap allows for duplicate keys.

   When an application has a multimap that needs to be transmitted via
   CBOR, it sends a map, except the value becomes an array of objects,
   all that have the same key.  One key sent, all of the objects with
   that key sent as an array, as the value to that key.

   Here is the ANTLR definition of a multimap in the CBOR language:

   multimap
     : 'multimap' '<' typeSpecifier ',' typeSpecifier '>'
     ;

                        Figure 15: multimap grammar

   A multimap is a map that allows multiple of the same keys.  Here is
   an example of a multimap of a graphic object being duplicated at
   multiple positions in a 3 dimensional space.

   The multimap uses the same sorting as described in Maps
   (Section 3.8.4.1)

   struct Vector3
   {
     float32_t X;
     float32_t Y;
     float32_t Z;
   };

   // An example of a multimap where the key is the identifier of
   // a specific graphic object type, with an ID that is an
   // unsigned 32-bit integer.
   //
   // And the value is its position.
   //
   // Any object may have multiple instances of the same graphic
   // object, all with the same ID, and each with its position
   // at a different location.
   //
   multimap<uint32_t,Vector3> Instances;

   This example would be transmitted as one CBOR map.  There would be
   one map key for each unique uint32_t key.  And Each key would have an
   array of one or more Vector3 objects.

Internet-Draft         CBOR Language Specification              May 2025


   The protocol compiler would implement; for each unique multimap, a
   method to convert and encode a computer language multimap into a CBOR
   map.  And a method to decode and convert the map back into a
   multimap.

3.9.  Arrays

   Arrays can be fixed length, or variable length.  Fixed length arrays
   have all of their elements transmitted each time, thus each element
   must contain a valid value.

3.9.1.  Fixed Length Arrays

   Fixed length arrays have their size bounded by square brackets.  Here
   are some examples:

   Variable Length Array Examples.

   // An array that consists of three 32 bit floating
   // point numbers.
   //
   float32_t Transform3D[3];

   // An array that contains 1024 8-bit signed integer values.
   //
   int8_t Samples[1024];

                         Figure 16: Arrays Examples

3.9.2.  Variable Length Arrays

   Variable length arrays can have a variable number of elements.  You
   can specify the minimum number of elements, the default is zero (0).
   You can specify the maximum number of elements, the default is an
   unlimited amount of entries.  An unlimited maximum value is indicated
   with the '*' symbol.

   Fixed length arrays have their size bounded by angle brackets.  Here
   are some examples:

   Variable Length Array Examples:

   // A variable length array that can hold zero,

   // 32-bit floating point numbers and no more than
   // 128 entries.
   //
   float32_t Trajectory<2,128>;

   // A variable length array that must contain at least 2
   // 32-bit floating point numbers and an unlimited
   // number of entries.
   //
   float32_t Variation<2,*>;

4.  Identifiers and Variables

   Each item encoded and decoded in an application will be paced into a
   memory location of the application at run time.  These places are
   named with identifiers.

   And the generic name for this kind of identifier is 'variable'.  And
   a variable may contain any kind of data the applications needs.
   These memory locations are named by the application developer and are
   called variables.

   Another usage of an identifier is to define a new data type to be
   used by the application.

   All variables have a data type (integer, float, ...) and are named in
   this language specification.  And there are user defined data types
   that build from the built in data types and other user defined data
   types.

4.1.  Identifiers and Scope

   Not all protocols will need to scope variables.  The primary reason
   for scoping is to reduce name collisions in larger and more complex
   protocols.



Royer                   Expires 27 November 2025               [Page 26]

Internet-Draft         CBOR Language Specification              May 2025


   An identifier can be public for any code to use.  This is in the
   'public' scope.

   Or they can be internal to the objects being described.  This is in
   the 'internal' scope.  For example, a protocol might also define a
   method to validate the data being provided.  This validation method
   might be scoped as internal so that access from other objects and
   public access is not possible.  In such cases the protocol is
   defining that the implementer must implement the defined validation
   method.

   Or they can only be accessible within a 'namespace'.  This is in the
   'namespace' scope.  A namespace is a way of identifying a collection
   of protocol names and definitions that may have names that are the
   same as the names used in a different namespace.  For example a
   "Get()" method may exist in a MIME namespace "MIME:Get()", and in a
   file namespace "FILE:Get()".  The namespace of protocol definitions,
   methods, and variables default to any namespace they are defined
   into, and my be defined and used by their full namespace path.  See
   Namespaces (Section 7).

4.1.1.  Publicly scoped Identifiers

   Public identifiers names must start with a letter from the UTF-8 set:
   a-z or A-Z.  And followed by zero or more from the set: a-z, A-Z,
   0-9, and underscore '_'.  Shown here as a POSIX regular expression
   for an identifier in the public scope: [a-z][A-Z]*

   And the ANTLR definition.  Where 'identifier' is any valid
   identifier, and 'IDENTIFIER' is a public identifier.

   identifier
       : IDENTIFIER
       | internal_identifier
       ;

   IDENTIFIER
     : [a-zA-Z] ([a-zA-Z0-9_])*
     ;


                       Figure 17: identifier grammar

   In the example Figure 18, Speed, TimeNow, Time9, Travel_Time,
   Collection, FirstItem and AValue are public identifiers.  As is the
   method name AMethodThatDoesSomething.

   int32_t, uint64_t, and float32_t are built in data types.

Internet-Draft         CBOR Language Specification              May 2025


   Collection is a public identifier that is defining the name of a new
   user defined data type.

   Examples:

   int32_t Speed;         // Okay public, follows the rules.

   UTC_t TimeNow;         // Okay public, follows the rules.

   float32_t Time9;       // Okay public, follows the rules.

   struct Collection      // 'Collection' is valid, and public.
   {
     int8_t    FirstItem; // Okay, value is public.

     float32_t AValue;    // Okay, value is public.

     /**
      * A public method that has access to all variables.
      *
      * @note 'void' means returns nothing.
      */
     void AMethodThatDoesSomething();
   };

                    Figure 18: Sample with Public Scope

4.1.2.  Internal Scoped Identifiers

   An internally scoped identifier is an identifier that starts with an
   underscore '_'.

   Internally scoped identifiers can only be accessed from within the
   object they are defined in.  They are often helper variables or
   methods.

   Internally scoped identifiers when not in a namespace and not in a
   struct, are only accessible within the generated code.

   Internally scoped identifiers in a namespace and not in a struct are
   namespace scoped.  And are accessible anywhere in the same namespace.

   Internally scoped identifiers inside of a struct, are only accessible
   within the struct.

   and 'internal_identifier' also included.

4.1.3.  Namespace Scoped Identifiers

   A namespace scoped identifier is an identifier that starts with an
   underscore '_'.  And exists inside of a 'namespace' and not within a
   struct.  See Section 7 to understand namespaces and Structs
   (Section 10) to understand 'struct'.

   Namespace scoped identifiers can only be accessed from within the
   same namespace they are defined in.  They are often variables and
   methods that aid in the cross coordination of objects within the
   namespace.

   *  An identifier defined inside of a struct that starts with an
      underscore '_' is an identifier that is only known within the
      struct and is an internally scoped identifier.

   *  An identifier that is in a namespace, and not within a struct is a
      namespace scoped identifier.

5.  Variables and Arrays

   Variables may be non-array, fixed size array, or variable sized
   array:

5.1.  Non-Array Variables

   A non-array variable is one that is not a fixed or variable sized
   array.  Examples:

   NOTE: A 'string' is always an array.

   Examples:

   uint8_t  SimpleUnsignedInteger;

   float32_t  Simple32BitFloat;

   map<uint8_t,AnObjectType>; SimpleMap;

   multimap<uint8_t,AnObjectType> SimpleMultiMap;

                   Figure 23: Variable No Arrays Example

5.2.  Fixed Size Array '[]'

   A fixed size array variable has a size enclosed in square brackets
   '[]'.  Examples:

   Examples:

   uint8_t  FixedUnsignedInteger[30];

   float32_t  Fixed32BitFloat[12];

   map<uint8_t,AnObjectType>; FixedMap[34];

   multimap<uint8_t,AnObjectType> FixedMultiMap[16];

   string LargeString[2048];

               Figure 24: Variable Fixed Size Array Examples

5.3.  Variable Size Array '<Min,Max>'

   A variable array size array has a minimum size.  The default minimum
   size is zero.

   A variable array has a maximum size.  The default maximum size is
   unlimited.

   The minimum and maximum values are separated by the comma (,)
   character.

   An variable array size is specified in one of 3 ways:

5.3.1.  Variable Size Array With Minimum and Maximum Size

   <Min,Max>
      Where:

      Min  Is the minimum size for the array.  The default minimum is
         zero.

      Max  Is the maximum size of the array.  The default minimum size
         is unlimited.  Unlimited may also be specified as '*'.

      Examples:

      // An array of 5 to 14 int8_t data elements.
      //
      int8_t VariableName<5,14>;

      // An array of 3 to 16 float32_t data elements.
      //
      float32_t FloatArray<3,16>;

      // An string of 5 to 42 characters.
      // The size would range from 5 to 168 octets in size.
      //
      string StringVariable<5,42>;

      // An string of 8 to unlimited characters.
      // The size would be from 8 to unlimited size.
      //
      string AString<8,*>;

5.3.2.  Variable Size Array With Maximum Size

   <Max>  A shorthand for <0,Max>.  Specifies a zero to Max sized array.

      Example:

      // And a size up to 68 octets.
      //
      string VariableName<17>;

6.  Declaring Variables

   A variable has a type and a name.  And the name can have some
   attributes.  The ANTLR for a variable declaration is:

   declaration : typeSpecifier identifier
     | typeSpecifier identifier '[' value ']'
     | typeSpecifier identifier '<' value? '>'
     | 'opaque' identifier '[' value ']'
     | 'opaque' identifier '<' value? '>'
     | 'string' identifier '<' value? '>'
     | 'void'
     ;


                       Figure 29: declaration grammar

7.  Namespaces

   With large protocols it can be difficult to make sure that names of
   items are unique.  Namespace allows groups of names to be
   encapsulated and identified without regard to the names of items in
   other namespaces or globally.

   For example, a protocol might have a unique identifier for the
   sequence of an item and declare a type called UID.

   Another set of exchanges might be to tranfer sets of data, each with
   a unique identifier and declare a type called UID.

   In this simple example, it is concevable that you just make sure that
   you do not use both in the same set.  However with large projects
   cross identifier errors can happen and can be difficult to track
   down.

   Namespace solve this problem by wrapping objects, or sets of object
   in a 'namespace' type.  Here is a simple example:

   // Declare a type called UID that is
   // a 64-bit unsigned integer.
   // In this scope is a sequence number.
   //
   typedef unint64_t UID;

   struct Packet
   {
     UID Sequence;
     Blob ABlobOdData; // Blob not defined in this example.
   };

   And in another definition file you might have defined this:





Royer                   Expires 27 November 2025               [Page 36]

Internet-Draft         CBOR Language Specification              May 2025


   // Declare a type called UID that is
   // a 64-bit unsigned integer.
   // In this scope, the UID identifies a set of data (Blob2).
   //
   typedef unint64_t UID;

   struct EnumeratedItems
   {
     UID ItemIdentifier;
           Blob2 TheItemData;// Blob2 not defined in this example.
   };

   And when you compile your protocol you get an error that you defined
   UID twice (or more).

   The solution could be to rename one of them.  Or to use namespaces:

   namespace Packets
   {
     // Declare a type called UID that is
     // a 64-bit unsigned integer.
     // In this scope is a sequence number.
     //
     typedef unint64_t UID;

     struct Packet
     {
       UID Sequence;
       Blob ABlobOdData; // Blob not defined in this example.
     };
   } // End of namespace /Packets'.

   namespace ItemList
   {
     // Declare a type called UID that is
     // a 64-bit unsigned integer.
     // In this scope, the UID identifies a set of data (Blob2).
     //
     typedef unint64_t UID;

     struct EnumeratedItems
     {
       UID ItemIdentifie;
       Blob2 TheItemData;// Blob2 not defined in this example.
     };
   }

Internet-Draft         CBOR Language Specification              May 2025


   When in the implementation where you need to access the public
   identifiers from other namespaces they could be identified by using
   their full scope.  In C++ this could look like:

   ItemList::EnumeratedItems Items;
   Packets::Packet           APacket

   ItemList::UID             ItemUID;
   Packets::UID              PacketUID;

   And in C# it would look like:

   ItemList.EnumeratedItems Items;
   Packets.Packet           APacket;

   ItemList.UID             ItemUID;
   Packets.UID              PacketUID;

8.  User Type Definitions

   A typedef is both a shorthand way of specifying a data type.  And it
   allows for the identification of the intended usage of otherwise
   ambiguous data type usage.  This can also help find coding errors.

   The typedef and its concept are the same as they are in C/C++.

   The ANTLR for typedef:

   typeDef
       : 'typedef' declaration ';'
       | 'enum' identifier enumBody ';'
       | structTypeSpec ';'
   //    | 'union' identifier unionBody ';'
       ;

                                 Figure 30

   In Figure 31 and Figure 32 there is an error as both the Sequence and
   Command are different sizes.  If one definition file has:

   struct Packet
   {
     // A map of Sequence to command.
     //
     map<uint32_t,uint32_t> History;
     ...
   };

Internet-Draft         CBOR Language Specification              May 2025


                                 Figure 31

   And a second file has a definition for a method to use the packet
   data:

   // On many systems this would compile
   // because the 'add' line would not know
   // that Sequence and command were too small as
   // the compilers automatically upcast to larger sizes.
   // Only later at runtime when Sequence or Command exceeded
   // the size of uint16_t might the errors be caught.
   //
   void ProcessPacket(uint16_t Sequence, uint16_t Command)
   {
     ...
     // Error - should be (Seq, Cmd)
     // However it would compile as the compiler
     // only sees that they are both unsigned integers.
     // (NOTE: map does not have a '.add', just an demonstration).
     //
     History.add(Cmd, Seq);
     ...
   }

                                 Figure 32

   If typedefs had been used it would catch that error and also make it
   easier to read:

   // Create a data type called 'PacketSequence'
   //
   typdef uint32_t PacketSequence;

   // Create a data type called 'PacketCommand'
   //
   typedef uint32_t PacketCommand;

   // Create a data type called 'SequenceHistory'
   //
   typedef map<PacketSequence,PacketCommand> SequenceHistory;

   struct Packet
   {
     // A map of Sequence to command.
     //
     SequenceHistory History;
     ...
   };

                                 Figure 33

   And if the second usage had been defined as:

   void ProcessPacket(PacketSequence Seq, PacketCommand Cmd)
   {
     // This would not compile as the types do not match.
     // (NOTE: '.add' is made up for demonstartion only)
     //
     History.add(Cmd, Seq); // Error - should be (Seq, Cmd)

     // This would, and should compile.
     //
     History.add(Seq,Cmd);
     ...
   }

                                 Figure 34

9.  Enum

   Much like an enum in C/C++/C# the purpose of the enum is to create
   identifiers and assign numeric values to them in order to simply
   reading and understanding the code.

   The enum ANTLR:

   enum       = 'enum' enum-name '{'
                 enum-item *(',' enum-item)
                '};'

   enum-item  = UserDefinedIdentifier '=' Value

   enum-name  = UserDefinedIdentifier

   Value      = 0x00-0xffffffff

   *  No two enum-item identifiers may be the same in the same enum.

   *  No two enum-item identifiers may have the same value in the same
      enum.

   *  All enum-items are at the same scope as the enum-name

   *  An enum-name and therefore the enum may be in the public,
      internal, or namespace scope.

   Examples:

10.  Structues

   Struct ANTLR:

   structTypeSpec
       : ('struct'|'class') identifier structBody
       ;
